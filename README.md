# Creating abstract city maps for Leaflet usage
Leaflet is a great way to display spatial information in an interactive way. If you want to display the difference between different neighborhoods you would usually get the proper shapefiles on the web and connect your data to them. But sometimes it does not need detailed shapefiles and you want more abstraction to get your information across. I came up with the idea to draw my own little simplified polygons to get an abstract map of Hamburg.

There are some great and free tools on the web to create your own polygons. I was using click2shp. You are just going to draw your polygons on a google map and afterwards you can export your polygons as a shapefile to use them from within R.
